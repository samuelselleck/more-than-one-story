	"instructions": "Begin with a short presentation of each player.  The oldest participant draws a card and reads it out loud. Holding the card, this player then tells a story.  The others listen actively and may encourage the story teller by asking questions. When the story teller decides to put the card down, then it is the next personâ€™s turn and the game continues clockwise.  If the group wishes, then time limits may be set for each story or the game itself.  Play as many rounds as you like. Free conversation is allowed between stories! Everybody wins!"
